# Daily Typing Test Progress

This repository is dedicated to tracking and improving my typing speed and accuracy through daily practice. I use various online typing test websites to measure my progress and upload the results here regularly.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to document my journey in improving my typing skills. By keeping a record of my daily typing tests, I aim to:

- Track my progress over time.
- Identify patterns or trends in my typing performance.
- Motivate myself to practice consistently.
- Share my journey with others who might be interested in improving their typing skills.
